# EVERY FRAME COUNTS
## Super Mario Bros - No Framrules

What has been holding back time saves for SMB speedrunners since the dawn of time? Framerules! For those who don't know, you can not beat the current level except for every 21 frames. I have modified the disassembly of the original game, and removed all area change timers. 

Included in this repo is a patch file, and the original assembly that I have modified.

Now every frame counts on every single level! Pipe entry timers are gone, so are level change timers. I also got rid of the world change timers, in case you would like to do a warpless speedrun. Whenever you beat a normal level, when the flag raises from the castle, it instantly changes to the next level. In a castle level, there is no wait after toad says, "THANK YOU MARIO, BUT OUR PRINCESS IS IN ANOTHER CASTLE".


## Installation

Use an IPS patch tool. I like [LIPX for Linux](https://github.com/kylon/Lipx). There is also [Lunar IPS for Windows](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/240/).

Patch your Super Mario Bros. Japan/USA rom file with the "smb-NoFramerules.ips" file in this repository. Then play the patched rom file! Enjoy.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. I would love to implement "no fireworks". It is annoying in levels like 8-3 that speedrunners have to wait so that they won't lose time to the fireworks going off.
